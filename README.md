### Testing 

When testing a specific package, inside the package's directory, use 

`go test -coverprofile /tmp/cp.out`

to run tests and show test coverage. To view the coverage in a browser, use 

`go tool cover -html=/tmp/cp.out` 

to visualize what parts of the code are not being tested.

To test all files, run 

`go test ./...`

from the root directory to test everything inside the repo.
